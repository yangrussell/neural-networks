# neural-networks
Implementation of a feedforward multilayer perceptron from first principles in Java

# Usage
1. Download files and open in an IDE
2. Alter the config.txt so it is in the following format:<br>
\# of input nodes<br>
\# of hidden layer nodes<br>
\# of output nodes<br>
\# value of lambda, the learning factor<br>
\# number of iterations to run for<br>
\# the type of boolean logic to be computed, either OR, AND, or XOR<br>
lower bound on RNG (space) upper bound on RNG<br>
See the config.txt file for an example
3. Run the main method of the Perceptron class
